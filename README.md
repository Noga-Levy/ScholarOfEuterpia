*PATCH NOTES*
Heyo!
Once the webapp was deployed (1 minute before the deadline, which was regrettable), I called it a day. However, the day after, I found out that the 504 error my site got was my fault (whoops). 
So, here are my "after deadline changes:"

1. I added streamlit to requirements.txt (day of, I didn't realize that I needed to), and removed python-dotenv.
2. I changed how to get the API key, because the website runs differently/has different requirements than a local machine--AKA, streamlit has a .toml I needed to put the key in, rather than a .env.
3. I added this README so I could explain myself. 

Please consider this disqualified--by trying to fix the website, I edited after the deadline. It would be unfair to the other participants if this project were judged as well.
